**Telecom Customer Churn Analysis**
* The purpose of this project is to examine Orange S.A.'s turnover rate and determine the elements that influence customer attrition. The Orange Telecom Churn Dataset, which comprises cleansed customer activity data and a churn label indicating whether a customer discontinued their membership, is the dataset used in this investigation.

**Problem Statement**
* The customer attrition rate at Orange Telecom is the issue this project attempts to solve. The number of consumers who cancel their subscription within a given time frame is referred to as customer churn. The goal is to investigate and evaluate the information in order to identify the primary causes of customer attrition. Recommendations to improve client retention will be given based on the results.

**Business Objective**
* This project's two main business goals are as follows:

-> Determine the main causes of client attrition: Our goal is to find patterns and correlations in the customer activity data that point to the reasons behind people canceling their subscriptions. Orange Telecom will be able to lower churn by taking proactive steps thanks to this understanding.

-> Make suggestions for client retention: We will provide Orange Telecom with practical suggestions for keeping its valuable customers, based on the analysis's findings. These suggestions can be for more focused marketing initiatives, better customer support, or service improvements to deal with specific problems.
